                Tic-tac-toe is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking empty squares with their symbols, typically "X" and "O". The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Players aim to strategically block their opponent while trying to create their own winning combinations. If a player successfully achieves three in a row, they win the game. If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw. It's a simple yet engaging game often enjoyed for its blend of strategy and simplicity.

                Rock-paper-scissors is a simple hand game typically played between two people. Each player can choose from one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The game has three possible outcomes: a draw, where both players choose the same shape, resulting in no winner; rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. The winner of each round is determined by the chosen shapes, and the game can be played in a single round or a series of rounds. It's often used as a decision-making tool or as a fun and quick way to settle disputes.            </div>

                Hangman is a word-guessing game played between two parties, typically one player (the guesser) and another (the word setter, which is the computer in this case). The game begins with the word setter choosing a word and keeping it secret from the guesser. The guesser tries to determine the secret word by suggesting letters one at a time. If the suggested letter is in the secret word, the word setter reveals all occurrences of that letter in the word. If the letter is not in the word, the word setter draws one part of a "hangman" diagram as a penalty. The game continues until the guesser either successfully guesses the word or makes too many incorrect guesses, resulting in the completion of the hangman diagram and the loss of the game. The guesser may also attempt to guess the entire word at any time, but if incorrect, it counts as a failed guess and contributes to completing the hangman. It's a classic word game that tests vocabulary, deduction skills, and luck.

                    Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game that involves uncovering hidden mines on a grid while avoiding detonating any of them. The game begins with a grid of covered squares. Some of these squares conceal mines, while others are safe. The objective is to uncover all the safe squares without revealing any mines. Each square may contain a number indicating the total count of mines in adjacent squares. Using these numbers as clues, players must deduce the locations of mines and mark them with flags. Players can uncover squares one at a time, and if they uncover a square with a mine, the game ends. Successful completion requires strategic thinking and careful deduction to systematically clear the grid without detonating any mines. Minesweeper is known for its addictive gameplay and challenging puzzles, and it's been a popular computer game since its introduction in the early 1990s.                </div>
